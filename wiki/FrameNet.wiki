#summary Description of the FrameNet lexicon

(Summarized from the [http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu FrameNet page]:)

The Berkeley FrameNet project is a lexicon-building effort for contemporary English in which expert annotators (1) select words with particular meanings; (2) describe the frames or conceptual structures which underlie these meanings; (3) examine sentences containing these words as found in a very large corpus of contemporary English; and (4) record the ways in which the components of the sentences containing these words express information about the frames they evoke.

The resulting database lists and defines the frames we needed for carrying out the research, offers annotations of selected sentences containing the words we studied, and summarizes, in lexical entries, the semantic and combinatorial properties discovered for individual lexical units.

The goal is to provide information in ways that are easily interpreted by human users and in a form that is usable by various kinds of computational processes.
