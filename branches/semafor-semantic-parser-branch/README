This is a README for SEMAFOR v2.0
=================================

SEMAFOR: Semantic Analysis of Frame Representations is a tool for automatic analysis of the frame-semantic structure of English text.

FrameNet (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) is a lexical resource that groups predicates in a hierarchy of structured concepts, known as *frames*. Each frame in the lexicon in turn defines several named *roles* corresponding to aspects of that concept (e.g. participants in an event).

This tool attempts to find which words in text evoke which semantic frames, and to find and label each frame's *arguments*--portions of the sentence that fill a role associated with the frame. It takes as input a file with English sentences, one per line, and performs the following steps:

  0. Preprocessing
     The sentences are lemmatized, part-of-speech tagged, and syntactically parsed (optionally using a syntactic parsing running in server mode.)

  1. Target identification
     Frame-evoking words and phrases ("targets") are heuristically identified in each sentence.

  2. Frame identification
     A log-linear model, trained on FrameNet 1.5 data with full-text frame annotations, produces for each target a probability distribution over frames in the FrameNet lexicon (optionally constrained by a semi-supervised filter). The target is then labeled with the highest-scoring frame.

  3. Argument identification
     A second log-linear model, trained on the same data, considers every role of each labeled frame instance and identifies a span of words in the sentence--or NULL--as filling that role. A subsequent step ensures that none of a frame's overt arguments overlap.

  4. Output
     An XML file is produced containing the text of the input sentences, augmented with the frame-semantic information (target-frame and argument-role pairings) predicted by the system. See the papers listed below ("Further Reading") for algorithmic details and experimental evaluation of the components of this system.

What follows is an overview of the organization of SEMAFOR's directory structure, and how it can be installed and run on new data.

2.1. Included Libraries
=======================
The lib/ directory contains the following library:

semafor-deps.jar: It contains all the required libraries that SEMAFOR needs to run.


3. Installation
===============

==Downloads==

SEMAFOR v2.0 can be downloaded from http://semafor-semantic-parser.googlecode.com/files/SEMAFOR-2.0.tgz

In preprocessing, SEMAFOR uses the MST Parser, a syntactic dependency parser created by Ryan McDonald. Download and unpack the following packaged version: http://semafor-semantic-parser.googlecode.com/files/stackedParserServer.tgz
The original MST parser has been modified to add an option of running it in server mode, for ease of use.

Download the model files both for the MST parser and SEMAFOR from here: http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR/SEMAFOR-2.0-models.tgz (~400MB)
The model file for the MST parser was trained on sections 02-21 of the WSJ section of the Penn Treebank, and the model files 
for SEMAFOR were trained on the FrameNet 1.5 datasets.


==Environment Variables==
The file named "config" under release/ lists a set of variables which should be modified within the file before running SEMAFOR:

SEMAFOR_HOME : absolute path where semaforV2.0.tgz has been decompressed.

TEMP_DIR : absolute path to a temporary directory for SEMAFOR to use.

MST_MODE : the provided MST parser package can now run in "server" or "noserver" modes; this variable should be set accordingly. When the parser is running on 
server mode, SEMAFOR takes several minutes less to initialize its models; hence, it is a very advantageous mode given that one has a high memory machine on which 
the MST parser can run.

MST_PARSER_HOME : absolute path where stackedParserServer.tgz has been decompressed.

MST_MACHINE : if MST parser is running on server mode, this variable should be set to the machine's name or IP address

MST_PORT : the port at which the MST parser is running on ${MST_MACHINE}. 

JAVA_HOME_BIN : the absolute path to the bin directory under which the executables javac and java can be found. If the environment variable ${JAVA_HOME} is set, 
${JAVA_HOME_BIN} should be ${JAVA_HOME}/bin.

MODEL_DIR : the absolute path where the tarball SEMAFOR-2.0-models.tgz has been decompressed.

GOLD_TARGET_FILE : the current version of SEMAFOR has a setting where input targets can be provided to it -- this is beneficial for users who are interested 
in a specific set of targets instead of all targets that SEMAFOR identifies using inbuilt heuristics (the target identification stage of the pipeline). To do this, this variable should be set to the absolute path of a file that contains space separated target spans for each sentence, per line. Take a look a ${SEMAFOR_HOME}/samples/sample_gold_targets.txt which corresponds to the input targets for sentences in ${SEMAFOR_HOME}/samples/sample_tokenized.txt. For best results, if an input target file is used, the user should provide tokenized sentences to SEMAFOR, because in this mode, SEMAFOR does not run inbuilt tokenization. If there is no input target file, this variable should be set to null.

AUTO_TARGET_ID_MODE : SEMAFOR has two automatic target identification models: "strict" and "relaxed". The "strict" mode uses morphological variants of all the targets seen in the FrameNet 1.5 lexicon and its training data. The "relaxed" mode labels all content words other than proper nouns as frame-evoking targets. Default is the "strict" mode.

USE_GRAPH_FILE : this should be set to "yes" or "no" depending on whether the user wants to used semi-supervised constraints for frame identification (see Das and Smith, 2011). This flag does not matter much when strict target identification is used. However, if the user uses an input target file and there are several targets which SEMAFOR did not see during supervised training, then setting the value of this environment variable will yield better results.


==Compilation==
Although Java 1.6 class files are included in this release both for SEMAFOR and the MST parser, one can compile both packages anew.
Assuming that the user is at the root of the directory where SEMAFOR was decompressed, run:

$  cd release/
$  ./cleanAndCompile.sh


4. Running the Frame-Semantic Parser
====================================

If the MST parser is to be run in server mode, in other words, if MST_MODE=server, then before running SEMAFOR, 
the user should log on to the chosen server machine (MST_MACHINE), install SEMAFOR exactly as described above and run:

$ cd release/
$ ./startMSTServer.sh

The message: "Waiting for Connection on Port: NNNNN" will appear once the server has loaded 
the parsing model and is ready to accept connections (takes a few minutes). Here NNNNN is the 
value of the MST_PORT variable.
After that log on to the machine where you want to run SEMAFOR.

Run the following commands to execute SEMAFOR.
$ cd release/
$ ./fnParserDriver.sh <absolute-path-to-input-file-with-one-sentence-per-line> [<output-file>]


5. Known Issues:
================
1. Currently, SEMAFOR requires 8GB of RAM to execute because of its dependence on the MST parser,
which loads a large model trained on the English Penn Treebank.	
2. The output of SEMAFOR is an XML file. If there are several thousand sentences to be parsed
by SEMAFOR, then it becomes cumbersome to view the XML file. Modifying fnParserDriver.sh to 
view raw text versions of SEMAFOR output is possible.

7. Version History
==================
1.0 - First public release (2010-04-26)
1.0.1 - Second public release (2010-09-02)
     Now includes compiled Java .class files for SEMAFOR, so compiling from source is 
     not necessary.
     
     Now includes the SemEval 2007 Task 19 dataset and evaluation resources (see
     README.txt in the SemEval2007/ directory for details).
     
     Bug fixes: 
     1) Fixed an issue of tokenization with 'sed'. Now uses 'sed -f' explicitly
        instead of running the script as an executable.
     2) Included 'mkdir tmp' in the MST parser root directory. This is necessary 
        for running the MST parser.
     3) At the top of the 'mxpost' script that does POS tagging, changed '#!/bin/ksh'
        to '#!/bin/bash' because the former did not run in some machines.
2.0 Third public release (2011-04-23)
    New features:
    1) Added server mode to the MST parser.
    2) Trained on newer, much larger dataset from FrameNet 1.5.
    3) Users can input their own targets file, suiting different domains and requirements.
    4) One class file does all the pipeline processing unlike the previous versions.
    5) The argument identification stage has been made much faster.
    6) Previous releases could not handle large set of sentences; that has been fixed.
    7) Added source to googlecode.com for open source development.
    8) Semi-supervised graph-based constraints have been added for frame identification.
